- use 'w' , 'a' , 's' , 'd' to move up, left, down or right respectively with the king/queen

- the colour of the buildings and the troops changes with their hp% (ranges are 100%-50% , 50%-25% , 25%-0%)
- if all the buildings are destroyed (does not include walls), and there are still some troops left alive, it is a victory for the user, and the user proceeds to the next level
- there are 3 levels in total, with increasing difficulty
- if all the troops are dead with some buildings (does not include walls) still intact in any level, it is defeat for the user
- you can run the replay.py file in the replays folder to see your previous games in the session
- let's say you play 3 games one after the other, then, if you want to see the replay of the second game, run replay.py , and give 2 as the input when prompted
- as mentioned, you can clear the saves by running the clear_session.py file in the replays folder.
